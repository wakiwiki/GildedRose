## How to Compile and Run?

I used NCrunch so you have to install it. After enabling NCrunch, you should just open GildedRoseTests file and let NCrunch run all tests.

If any test gets failed, there will be red circles beside the lines and for passed tests there will be green ones. Also if there are codes not covered by tests, there will be white circles beside them.

Also you can set GildedRoseTests project as Startup and run it across the TexttestFixture class.

This kata covered all codes in UpdateQuality method of GildedRose class. I also used FluentAssertion for more readable experience;
